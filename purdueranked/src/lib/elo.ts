 * ELO Rating Algorithm Implementation

 * where:
 * - R'a is the new rating of player A
 * - Ra is the current rating of player A
 * - K is a factor (usually between 16-32) that determines how much ratings change
 * - Sa is the actual score (1 for win, 0.5 for draw, 0 for loss)
 * - Ea is the expected score based on current ratings
 * 
 * Expected score formula: Ea = 1 / (1 + 10^((Rb-Ra)/400))
